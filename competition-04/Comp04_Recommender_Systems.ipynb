    "## Overview\n",
    "In this competition, your goal is to design a recommender system that suggests news articles to users. The performance of your recommender system will be assessed using a simulation environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each timestep, the simulation environment randomly selects an active user with a given user_id. Once you receive this user_id, your recommender system must generate a slate (a list of 5 distinct item_ids to recommend to the current user) and pass it to the environment. The environment then uses its internal information to determine which item the user will choose from the recommended list (with some degree of stochasticity) or decide not to choose any item due to a lack of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each user has a latent patience value (invisible to your recommender system), which slightly increases when an item is chosen and drastically decreases when no item is chosen in each round. If a user's patience drops below 0 or the user runs out of the time budget (2000 timesteps), the user leaves the environment. The chosen item_id (or -1 if no item is chosen) and whether the current user stays (True) or leaves (False) are returned as the result of recommending a slate of items. A new user (if any) will be randomly selected for recommendations in the next timestep after the response of the current user is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your recommender system should continue recommending items to the current user at each timestep as long as there are still active users in the environment. The simulation process terminates after all users have left the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to maximize the session length of each user. The session length is defined as the number of timesteps a user interacts with your recommender system before leaving the environment. The calculated session length score, normalized to the range of 0 ~ 1, will be provided by the simulation environment after the completion of the simulation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "在這個競賽中，你的目標是設計一個推薦系統，向使用者推薦新聞文章。你的推薦系統的性能將使用模擬環境進行評估。\n",
    "\n",
    "在每個時間步驟，模擬環境會隨機選擇一個具有特定 user_id 的活躍使用者。一旦你收到這個 user_id，你的推薦系統必須生成一個 slate（一個包含 5 個不同 item_id 的推薦清單）並將其傳遞給環境。然後，環境使用內部信息來決定使用者將從推薦清單中選擇哪個項目（具有一定程度的隨機性），或者因缺乏興趣而決定不選擇任何項目。\n",
    "\n",
    "每個使用者都有一個潛在的耐心值（對你的推薦系統不可見），當選擇一個項目時稍微增加，而當在每個回合中未選擇任何項目時則大幅減少。如果使用者的耐心值降到低於 0，或者使用者用完時間預算（2000 個時間步驟），則使用者將離開環境。選擇的 item_id（如果沒有選擇任何項目則為 -1）以及當前使用者是否留下（True）或離開（False）將作為推薦一系列項目後的結果返回。在生成當前使用者的回應之後，下一個時間步驟將隨機選擇新的使用者進行推薦。\n",
    "\n",
    "只要環境中仍然有活躍的使用者，你的推薦系統應該在每個時間步驟繼續向當前使用者推薦項目。當所有使用者都離開系統後，模擬過程將終止。\n",
    "\n",
    "你的目標是最大化每個使用者的會話長度。會話長度定義為使用者與你的推薦系統互動的時間步驟數，在離開環境之前。計算出的會話長度得分將在模擬過程完成後由模擬環境提供，並歸一化為 0 ~ 1 的範圍內。"
